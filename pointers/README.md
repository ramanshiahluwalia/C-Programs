# Pointers in C Programming
Pointers are a fundamental concept in the C programming language. Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. They are an important tool for dynamic memory allocation and passing data between functions. This code example demonstrates the use of pointers in C programming.




## Explanation
In this code, the variable x is assigned the value 7. Then, a pointer variable p is declared, which is used to store the memory address of x. The & operator is used to get the memory address of x, which is then assigned to p.





````
int*p;
p=&x;
````
The printf statements are then used to display the memory address of x and the value of x. The memory address stored in p is also displayed, as well as the memory address of p itself.


````
printf("The memory address is :%d\n",*p);
printf("value of x is : %d\n",x);
printf("%d\n",&x);
printf("%d\n",p);
printf("%d\n",&p);
````

## Usage
Pointers are useful in a wide range of applications such as dynamic memory allocation and passing data between functions. The use of pointers can help optimize code and improve performance. It is important to properly understand pointers before attempting to use them in your code.
## Sample output
````
The memory address is :7
value of x is : 7
3215059348
3215059348
3215059344
````
Here, we can see that the memory address of x is 3215059348. When we dereference the pointer p using the * operator, we get the value stored at that memory address, which is 7. The memory address of p itself is 3215059344.

In summary, this code demonstrates the basic use of pointers in C, including how to declare and initialize a pointer, how to get the memory address of a variable using the & operator, and how to dereference a pointer using the * operator
