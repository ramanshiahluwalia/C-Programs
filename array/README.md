# Arrays in C

This C program demonstrates how to use arrays in programming. An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type. In this program, an integer array with 5 elements is created and initialized with values.

To create an array in C, define the data type (like int) and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets []. To insert values, use a comma-separated list inside curly braces.



## Initialization

Arrays are a fundamental data structure in the C programming language. They are a collection of homogeneous data items, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays are used to store and manipulate data efficiently, and are commonly used in programs for tasks such as storing large amounts of data, implementing data structures, and processing data.

```
int x[5] = {2, 10, 15, 17, 21};

```
## use

To use the program, compile the source code using a C compiler and run the resulting executable file. Then follow the on-screen instructions to input a number and see the corresponding element from the array.
